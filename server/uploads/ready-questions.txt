So I have this application: An app made for marketing agencies to make their job easier and reduce time-consuming tasks. Our main features are generating marketing copies with the help of AI, managing clients in an intuitive UI with multiple options and creating ad previews for the clients. Some DB calls would be: getAllUserAgencies, getAllAgencyClients, etc. Tell me how could I apply caching on top of this architecture.
